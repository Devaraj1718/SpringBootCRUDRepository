# SpringBootCRUDRepository
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete â€” the fundamental operations for managing data in a system. It involves creating new records, retrieving existing ones, updating their information, and removing them as needed.
Sure, here's a concise explanation of how to perform product adding, updating, and deleting using a Spring Boot application with a MySQL database:

1. **Product Adding:** In a Spring Boot app, capture user input for new products, use JPA to save them to a MySQL database.

2. **Updating Product:** Retrieve a product by its ID, modify details, and save changes using JPA's update capabilities.

3. **Deleting Product:** Locate a product by ID, and use JPA to remove it from the MySQL database.

4. **Running the Application:** Compile and run the Spring Boot app, ensuring the MySQL database connection is configured in the application properties.

5. **Creating Database:** Configure Spring Boot to create MySQL tables by specifying JPA entities and enabling `ddl-auto` in properties.

Remember, this overview provides a simplified understanding. In a real application, you'd need to set up entity classes, repositories, services, controllers, and manage database configurations more comprehensively.
